Squash and Stretch Demo

Hello, and welcome to our squash and stretch assignment featuring the amazing squishy rubber ducky (NOT FOR SALE).

	Navigate to PROJECTFOLDER > Assets > _Project > Scenes > SquashNStretch.Unity to open our scene.
	
In play mode, you can observe 3 glorious ducks. The one on the right is animated using Maya, and the other on the left
is animated using scripts in Unity. The third mysterious duck in the background is for experimentation.
There are two component scripts, the main script to pay attention to is "SnSAnim".
This script can be applied to the handle of any model and it will demonstrate a jumping animation with squash
and stretch. You can control parameters such as; speed, jump height, and SnS factor in the script component window.

Speed - Affects the speed of the animation.
Jump Height - Affects how high the model will jump in the animation.
Squash Factor - Affects the distortion rate of squash and stretch.

The animation was set-up using a basic key-frame system and LERP vector functions.

Model created by Owen Meier and tweaked by Josh Bellyk (I gave the head a makeover).


The end. So long and thanks for all the fish.
